/**
 * @fileoverview The ONE status enum of the evidence page (ADR-0021, ADR-0022).
 *
 * The values live in `statuses.json`, read by this module AND by the
 * `evidence-artifact` skill's `scripts/build.py`, so the pack validator, the
 * page and the Sprint Board can never disagree on a status. Each field accepts
 * only its own subset: a case marked `RETEST PASSED` is refused by the
 * validator instead of rendering neutral. The list is ADD-ONLY.
 *
 * Case statuses ARE the sprint source's `TestStatus` (ADR-0019), so a case and
 * a TMS test speak the same vocabulary: PASSED and FAILED only on observation,
 * BLOCKED and DEFERRED as reasons a test is NOT RUN. `statuses.test.ts` holds
 * the JSON to these types.
